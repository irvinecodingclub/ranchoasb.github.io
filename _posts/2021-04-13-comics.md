Cameron loves doing art in his free time, and participated in other activities such as the New Year Resolution Contest. On average, Cameron spends more time coming up with the ideas for the comics than drawing.

> They usually take 1-3 hours to finish so not too long, but I think the most time consuming part is coming up with the idea.

Thanks, Cameron for the wonderful artwork!
