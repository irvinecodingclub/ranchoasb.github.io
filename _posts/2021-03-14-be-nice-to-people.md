Be nice to people is rancho's school motto, but it is also more than that. Having kindness and empathy is an essential human principle and a trait we need to value as a community. ASB recognizes that kindness is an important part of everyone's lives and can brighten anyone's day so we strive to live by our school motto and promote it in everyone's daily activities.
