The results are out! Thank you to everyone who participated. Students were asked to display their New Year's Resolution in the form of artistic expression. We had many great entries, but in the end, the category winners were:

Best Overall - Quinne Davis, with her stunning cello performance  
Most Original - Cameron Weng, with his stylistic and creative artwork of meditation  
Most Inspirational - Sarah Chen, with her colorful calligraphy  

Cameron Weng, winner of the category "Most Original" gives a statement on his drawing.

>I already had a new year's resolution planned out and a drawing would just solidify the plan. I really think that the style in which I drew this piece reflects the way I feel while meditating.

The calm and peaceful background of the piece seems to agree, too.

Congrats to all participants!
