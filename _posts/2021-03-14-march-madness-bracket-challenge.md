Don't be discouraged to join if you don't know anything about this, everyone has a fair chance of winning the prize!
The deadline for bracket submissions is 3/17. Students are encouraged to participate, please share this with your friends! Check out the poster attached. It contains a QR code that also links to the google form. Thank you all for your time, have fun!
