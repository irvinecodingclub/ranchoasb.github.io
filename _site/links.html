We had many great entries, but in the end, the category winners were: Best Overall - Quinne Davis, with her stunning cello performanceMost Original - Cameron Weng, with his stylistic and creative artwork of meditationMost Inspirational - Sarah Chen, with her colorful calligraphy Cameron Weng, winner of the category “Most Original” gives a statement on his drawing.  I already had a new year’s resolution planned out and a drawing would just solidify the plan. I really think that the style in which I drew this piece reflects the way I feel while meditating. The calm and peaceful background of the piece seems to agree, too. Congrats to all participants! "
