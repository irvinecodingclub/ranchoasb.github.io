Thank you to everyone who participated. Students were asked to display their New Year’s Resolution in the form of artistic expression. We had many great entries, but in the end, the category winners were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best Overall - Quinne Davis, with her stunning cello performance&lt;br /&gt;
Most Original - Cameron Weng, with his stylistic and creative artwork of meditation&lt;br /&gt;
Most Inspirational - Sarah Chen, with her colorful calligraphy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cameron Weng, winner of the category “Most Original” gives a statement on his drawing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I already had a new year’s resolution planned out and a drawing would just solidify the plan. I really think that the style in which I drew this piece reflects the way I feel while meditating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The calm and peaceful background of the piece seems to agree, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congrats to all participants!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Melody Yu</name></author><category term="featured" /><summary type="html">The results are out!
